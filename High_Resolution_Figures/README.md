High resolution figures and supplemental tables as referenced in the paper

## Supplementary_Table_1_Barcodes

List of 80,862 sgRNAs targeting 20,393 genes included in the whole genome library.

## Supplementary_Table_2_Hit_lists_1_fdr

List of the compartment and whole cell hits from the 3 whole genome screens. 
These results come from the notebook in the Hit_Calling folder used to create the hit lists. 

## Supplementary_Table_2_Hit_lists_5_fdr

List of the compartment and whole cell hits from the 3 whole genome screens generated with a higher false discovery rate than used in the manuscript for biological exploration.
We provide this for researchers interested in mining PERISCOPE screen data across a broader swatch of biology with teh caveat that overall signal is reduced when using a less stringent false discovery rate.

## Supplementary_Table_3_GSEA_clusters

List of the GSEA clusters, identified as described in the methods and based on the .rnk files created by the notebook in the Supplemental_8 folder.
