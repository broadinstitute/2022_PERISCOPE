This notebook generates sample singe cell visualizations as shown in Supplemental Figure 5.
Input parameters can be set as desired to access single cells by desired gene or perturbation.

The time required to run this notebook is dependent upon the number of genes/perturbations that you would like to visualize.
This notebook requires ~1 hour computation time for a normal desktop computer on the sample parameters included.
