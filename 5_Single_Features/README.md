This notebook generates the analysis and figure described in Figure 6.

If you would like to perform the manual profile aggregation included in this notebook, you will need to download the following files to the `inputs_data` folder.
`20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_ALLBATCHES___{plate}___ALLWELLS.csv.gz`
`20200805_A549_WG_Screen_guide_normalized_ALLBATCHES___{plate}___ALLWELLS.csv.gz`

The following command will download these files:
```bash
aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0021-periscope/broad/workspace/profiles/ inputs_data --exclude "*" --include "HeLa/20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_ALLBATCHES___*" --include "A549/20200805_A549_WG_Screen_guide_normalized_ALLBATCHES___*"
```

The per-experiment profiles that are generated by aggregation are:
`20200805_A549_WG_Screen_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES_ALLWELLS.csv`
`20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES___DMEM___ALLWELLS.csv`
`20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES___HPLM___ALLWELLS.csv`

The following commands will download these files:
```bash
aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0021-periscope/broad/workspace/profiles/A549/20200805_A549_WG_Screen_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES_ALLWELLS.csv inputs_data/

aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0021-periscope/broad/workspace/profiles/HeLa/20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES___DMEM___ALLWELLS.csv inputs_data/

aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0021-periscope/broad/workspace/profiles/HeLa/20210422_6W_CP257_guide_normalized_median_merged_ALLBATCHES___HPLM___ALLWELLS.csv inputs_data/
```

The subsets of data from the per-experiment profiles that are used in this notebook are already present in the `outputs/` folder so you can skip both profile aggregation and downloading the full aggregated profiles and still run this notebook.

You do not need to download any input images; the `inputs_images` folder already has example images.
